## 2026-10-08: Pre-build findings (planning session)

- **No containers.**
  - Code execution uses Dynamic Workers (the Worker Loader).
  - Typecheck and type-surface use the TypeScript compiler API inside the Worker.
  - Reason: Sandbox SDK 1.0 changed its API, and containers need Docker at deploy time.
- **The Artifacts binding is remote-only, even in `wrangler dev`.**
  - Hence the `RepoStore` port with a memory fake.
  - `REPO_STORE=memory` gives fully local dev.
- **Artifacts push events are repo-level only.**
  - Subscribe `pushed` on trunk only.
  - For fork pushes, our code emits its own events.
- **TypeScript in a Worker bundles to about 1.7 MB gzip.**
  - It needs `define` for `__filename` and `__dirname`.
  - Runtime is not yet verified; T00 verifies it.
- **Verified locally:** a Durable Object and the Worker Loader both work under `wrangler dev` (wrangler 4.149.0).
- **Premise surface hash** = the exported declaration text from `.d.ts` emit, with comments removed. It never includes function bodies.
- **Behavioural premises** exist only as executable assertions.

## 2026-10-08: T00 results

All three spikes pass, locally (`wrangler dev`) and deployed. Code is in `spikes/` (throwaway). Versions: wrangler 4.149.0, typescript 5.9.3, isomorphic-git 1.43.2.

**1. Artifacts create / fork / read / push from a Worker: works.**

- **A shallow-clone push to a fork works** (`singleBranch: true, depth: 1`, then commit, then push `main`). A full clone works too. No fallback was needed.
- After the push, `log({ limit: 5 })` on the fork returns 2 commits (the fork's new commit, then the base commit), and `readFile` returns the pushed text.
- `fork()` resolves only when the fork is usable: `get()` on the new fork succeeded on the first try every time (0 retries in 7 runs). The spike keeps a retry loop anyway.
- Timings in ms. The repo is tiny (2 files, 1 commit), so these are floor values, and shallow vs full clone cannot be told apart at this size.

| Step | Deployed (3 runs) | Local dev, remote binding (4 runs) |
|---|---|---|
| `create()` | 1375–2007 | 1538–2684 |
| first push to base | 362–663 | 461–797 |
| `fork()` | **2598–3134** | 2477–3326 |
| `get()` on the new fork | 20–44 | 393–822 |
| `readFile()` | 68–103 | 104–214 |
| clone, `depth: 1` | 264–343 | 375–747 |
| clone, full | 366 | 468 |
| push to fork | 339–421 | 336–1276 |
| `log()` | 19–27 | 29–61 |

- **`fork()` takes about 3 s and `create()` about 1.5–2 s.** These are the slow steps. T12 and T18 must fork concurrently, not one after another, or 300 agents will take 15 minutes just to fork.
- `ArtifactsCommitMetadata` fields: `hash`, `treeHash`, `message`, `author`, `committer`, `parents`, `authoredAt`, `committedAt` (unix seconds).

**2. TypeScript compiler API in a Worker: works** (typescript 5.9.3, no downgrade needed).

- Emits `.d.ts` for both in-memory files with `diagnostics: []`, using `lib.es2022` (57 lib files loaded).
- **ts emit: 47–139 ms** in local dev (first call 102–139, warm 47–59).
- Loader run and ts emit cannot be timed inside a deployed Worker: `Date.now()` does not advance during synchronous CPU work in production, so `/ts` reports `ms: 0` there. From the client, deployed `/ts` took 0.53–1.43 s wall time including TLS and cold start. **Any metric we show for CPU-bound work (T19, T23) must be measured across an I/O boundary or it will read 0.**
- Workarounds:
  - `define` for `__filename` and `__dirname` is set as the task specified. I did not test whether it is still required without it.
  - **Lib loading:** used the generator script, not Wrangler `Text` rules. `spikes/scripts/gen-libs.mjs` writes `src/ts-libs.generated.ts` (57 files, 485 KB raw) exporting a `Record<fileName, text>`. It skips `*.full.d.ts`, which pull in the DOM libs.
  - **The compiler API wants lib file names, not tsconfig short names:** `lib: ["lib.es2022.d.ts"]`, with `getDefaultLibLocation: () => "/lib"` and the host serving `/lib/<fileName>`.
  - Also set `types: []` so the program does not look for `@types`.

**3. Dynamic Worker test runner: works. No import rewriting needed.**

- `/loader` returns `[{"name":"adds","ok":true}]`.
- **Relative imports resolve between path-like module names.** Modules were keyed `runner.js`, `src/math.js`, `tests/math.test.js`. `runner.js` imports `./tests/math.test.js`, which imports `../src/math.js`. T14 can use repo-relative paths as module names with `.ts` swapped for `.js`; source imports must already use the `.js` extension.
- **Loader run: 2–3 ms** in local dev, 14–23 ms deployed (deployed is measurable because the RPC call is I/O). Transpiling both modules with `ts.transpileModule`: 1–17 ms locally.
- The main module needs only the named `WorkerEntrypoint` class export; no default export.

**Bundle size** (from `wrangler deploy`): `Total Upload: 11790.25 KiB / gzip: 1887.90 KiB`, Worker startup time 83 ms. That is TypeScript, isomorphic-git and the lib strings together.

**Surprises and deviations the next session must know:**

- **The docs' MemoryFS helper does not work with isomorphic-git 1.43.2 as copied.** `git.init` throws `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bind')`. Two gaps:
  1. isomorphic-git requires `readlink` and `symlink` on `fs.promises`.
  2. It branches on Node-style `err.code` (`ENOENT`, `EEXIST`, `ENOTDIR`); the helper only puts the code in the message. It also expects a single-level `mkdir` that throws `EEXIST`.
  - `spikes/src/memory-fs.ts` is the verbatim copy. `spikes/src/git-fs.ts` is a 60-line adapter that fixes both. **T03 should start from the adapter**, not from the docs helper.
- `/loader` returns exactly the results array as its body, to match the acceptance check. Its timings are in an `x-timings` response header instead of the JSON body.
- `/artifacts` deletes its two repos in a `finally` block (`?keep=1` skips this; `?depth=full` does a full clone). A `/cleanup` route deletes any repo named `spike-*`.
- `wrangler dev` shows the Artifacts binding as `remote` with no extra config, and prints a warning that goes away with `"remote": true` on the binding.
- `wrangler types` asks for `@types/node` because of `nodejs_compat`. Not installed in the spike; T01 should add it.
- Generated files `spikes/worker-configuration.d.ts` and `spikes/src/ts-libs.generated.ts` are git-ignored. `npm run typecheck` in `spikes/` regenerates both.

**Left behind in the Cloudflare account:**

- The Worker `premise-spikes` was deleted on 2026-10-08 after the spikes passed (`npx wrangler delete --name premise-spikes`). Its routes had no auth, so redeploy it only for a short test and delete it again.
- The Artifacts namespace `premise-spike` exists and is empty (checked with `wrangler artifacts repos list`).

**Human setup still open:** there is no `.dev.vars` yet, so H3 (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and H5 (`ADMIN_TOKEN`) are not done. T00 did not need them. H1, H2 and H4 are done.
